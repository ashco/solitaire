## How to Play

Your goal is to place all cards of the same suit in their respective holding areas, from Ace to King. Once you have done this and cleared the board, you've won! 

Manipulate the board to uncover hidden cards and reveal new moves. You can move cards by stacking alternating Red and Black cards in sequential order (Red 6 on Black 7 on Red 8). Only Kings can be placed in empty columns. 

Click through the deck to cycle through extra cards if you run out of moves on the board. 

Click once to select, click again to move.
